The 15 Puzzle Problem
1. Problem Description
The 15 Puzzle is problem consisting of a 4×4 grid with 15 numbered tiles and one empty space. The tiles can be moved by sliding a tile into the empty space. The aim is to reach a predefined goal configuration from a given initial configuration.

2. Goal of the Problem
To arrange the tiles in ascending numerical order (1–15) with the empty space located at the bottom-right corner of the grid.

3. Constraints
	1.	The puzzle contains 15 tiles and 1 empty space.
	2.	Only one tile can be moved at a time.
	3.	A tile can move only into the empty space.
	4.	Allowed moves are Up, Down, Left, and Right.
	5.	Diagonal moves are not allowed.
	6.	Each move has a uniform cost of 1.
	7.	The puzzle must always remain in a valid 4×4 configuration.

4. Problem Representation
State Representation
A state is represented as a one-dimensional array of 16 elements, where:
	•	Numbers 1–15 represent tiles
	•	0 represents the empty space
Example:

(1, 2, 3, 4,
 5, 6, 7, 8,
 9, 10, 11, 12,
 13, 0, 14, 15)

5. State Space Formulation
The 15-Puzzle can be formulated as:
SS = (S, A, Result, Cost)
	•	S (States): All possible configurations of the puzzle
	•	A (Actions): {Up, Down, Left, Right}
	•	Result(S, a): New state after applying action a to state S
	•	Cost(S, a): Each action has a cost of 1

6. Solution Algorithm
Algorithm: Solve the 15-Puzzle
	1.	Start.
	2.	Define the initial state and the goal state.
	3.	Insert the initial state into the frontier.
	4.	Initialize an empty explored set.
	5.	While the frontier is not empty:
	1.	Remove a state from the frontier.
	2.	If the state satisfies the goal test, output the solution path and stop.
	3.	Add the state to the explored set.
	4.	Generate all valid successor states by moving the empty space.
	5.	Add unvisited successor states to the frontier.
	6.	If the frontier becomes empty without reaching the goal, report failure.
	7.	Stop.
