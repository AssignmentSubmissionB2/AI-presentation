Title: Solving Cryptarithmetic Using Recursive Backtracking

Problem Description:
Cryptarithmetic puzzles replace digits with letters in arithmetic equations. The goal is to assign a unique digit (0-9) to each letter such that the equation holds true and no two letters have the same digit. Leading letters cannot be zero.

Approach:
This problem is solved using a recursive backtracking algorithm, which is a depth-first search technique commonly used in AI.

Steps:
1. Extract all unique letters from the puzzle.
2. Assign digits to letters one by one recursively.
3. Ensure:
	- No two letters share the same digit.
	- Leading letters are not assigned zero.
4. After assigning all letters, check if the arithmetic equation is satisfied.
5. If not satisfied, backtracking and try another digit.

Constraints:
•	Uniqueness Constraint
Each letter must be assigned a different digit. No two letters can share the same value.
•	Digit Range Constraint
All digits must be between 0 and 9.
•	Leading Zero Constraint
A number cannot begin with zero. Therefore, leading letters (such as S in SEND or M in MORE) cannot be assigned the digit 0.
•	Arithmetic Constraint
The arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, or multiplication) must be mathematically correct.
•	Carry Constraint
Carry-over values from one column to the next must be handled correctly.


Why Backtracking?
Backtracking systematically explores all possible combinations while cutting invalid solutions early, making it efficient for constraint-based problems.

This approach simulates how an AI agent searches through a problem space to find a valid solution.
